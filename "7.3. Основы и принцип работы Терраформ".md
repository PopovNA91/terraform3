## Задание 2
1. Вывод команды terraform workspace list.
```
nikolay@nikolay-VirtualBox:~/terraform$ terraform workspace list
  default
* prod
  stage
```
2. Вывод команды terraform plan для воркспейса prod.
```
nikolay@nikolay-VirtualBox:~/terraform$ terraform plan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

data.aws_region.current: Refreshing state...
data.aws_caller_identity.current: Refreshing state...

Plan: 4 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + AWS_account_ID = "774510604010"
  + AWS_region     = "us-west-2"
  + AWS_user_ID    = "AIDA3IVDN53VNG2UOWDLH"

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
